##What is a Nonogram?

> Nonograms, also known as Hanjie, Picross or Griddlers, are picture logic puzzles in which cells in a grid must be colored or left blank according to numbers at the side of the grid to reveal a hidden picture. In this puzzle type, the numbers are a form of discrete tomography that measures how many unbroken lines of filled-in squares there are in any given row or column.

In a Nonogram you are given the number of elements in the rows and columns. A row/column where containing no element has a '0' all other rows/columns will have at least one number.

Each number in a row/column represent sets of elements next to each other.

If a row/column have multiple sets, the declaration of that row/column will have multiple numbers. These sets will always be at least 1 cell apart.

*An example*


| | |2|1|1| |
---|---|----|----|----|----|----
| |1|1|1|2|1
|2| |*|*| |
1|2| |*| |*|*
|0| | | | |
2|1|*|*| |*|
|2| | |*|*|
