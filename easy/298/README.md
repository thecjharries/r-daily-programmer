## Prompt

Difficulty may be higher than easy,

`(((3)))` is an expression with too many parentheses.

The rule for "too many parentheses" around part of an expression is that if removing matching parentheses around a section of text still leaves that section enclosed by parentheses, then those parentheses should be removed as extraneous.

`(3)` is the proper stripping of extra parentheses in above example.

`((a((bc)(de)))f)` does not have any extra parentheses.  Removing any matching set of parentheses does not leave a "single" parenthesesed group that was previously enclosed by the parentheses in question.

**inputs:**

    ((a((bc)(de)))f)
    (((zbcd)(((e)fg))))
    ab((c))

**outputs:**

    ((a((bc)(de)))f)
    ((zbcd)((e)fg))
    ab(c)

# bonus
A 2nd rule of too many parentheses can be that parentheses enclosing nothing are not needed, and so should be removed.  A/white space would not be nothing.

**inputs:**

      ()
      ((fgh()()()))
      ()(abc())

**outputs:**

      NULL
      (fgh)
      (abc)
