## Prompt

#Description

For those that don't tweet or know the workings of Twitter, you can reply to 'tweets' by replying to that user with an @ symbol and their username.

Here's an example from [John Carmack's](https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack) twitter.

**His** **initial** **tweet**

@ID_AA_Carmack : "Even more than most things, the challenges in computer vision seem to be the gulf between theory and practice."

**And** **a** **reply**

@professorlamp : @ID_AA_Carmack Couldn't say I have too much experience with that


You can see, the '@' symbol is more or less an integral part of the tweet and the reply. Wouldn't it be neat if we could think of names that incorporate the @ symbol and also form a word?

e.g.

@tack -> (attack)

@trocious ->(atrocious)



#Formal Inputs & Outputs

##Input description

As input, you should give a word list for your program to scout through to find viable matches. The most popular word list is good ol' [enable1.txt](https://code.google.com/p/dotnetperls-controls/downloads/detail?name=enable1.txt)

/u/G33kDude  has supplied an even bigger text file. I've hosted it on my site over [here](http://www.joereynoldsaudio.com/WordList.txt) , I recommend 'saving as' to download the file.

##Output description

Both outputs should contain the 'truncated' version of the word and the original word. For example.

    @tack : attack

There are two outputs that we are interested in:

* The 10 longest twitter handles sorted by length in descending order.
* The 10 shortest twitter handles sorted by length in ascending order.

#Bonus

I think it would be even better if we could find words that have 'at' in them at any point of the word and replace it with the @ symbol. Most of these wouldn't be valid in Twitter but that's not the point here.

For example

r@@a -> (ratata)


r@ic@e ->(raticate)


dr@ ->(drat)
