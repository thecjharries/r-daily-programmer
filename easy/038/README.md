# [4/10/2012] Challenge #38 [easy]

## Note

This is not an easy challenge at all given that it first requires building a graph data structure, then adding functionality on that graph structure, then implementing the algorithm.

It is fairly straightforward and mostly plug and chug from Wikipedia, but I'm not in the mood for tedium today.
