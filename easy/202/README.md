## Prompt

#Description

Poor Mr.Tinkles is having some troubles. Similar to [The Loneliest Whale In The World](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52-hertz_whale), no one can hear his cries. Or in this case, understand them.

He talks in a sequence of on's and off's. 0's and 1's, it's binary. Obviously as a mere human you can't possibly translate what he's saying as he says it. Looks like you'll have to think of a way around this....

#Formal Inputs &amp; Outputs

##Input description

On console input you will be given a variable number of 0's and 1's that correspond to letters in the alphabet [a-z] and whitespace ' '. These will be integers coming in, it's your job to cast them however you need.


##Output description

The program should output the english translation (or other languages if you feel so inclined!) of the binary phrase
