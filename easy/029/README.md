## Prompt

A [Palindrome](http://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/Palindrome) is a sequence that is the same in reverse as it is forward.

I.e. hannah, 12321.

Your task is to write a function to determine whether a given string is palindromic or not.


Bonus:  Support multiple lines in your function to validate Demetri Martin's [224 word palindrome poem](https://web.archive.org/web/20090413081928/http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2009/02/demetri-martins-palindrome-poem.html).
