## Prompt

#Description

A bogo sort is a purposefully inefficient algorithm for sorting a sequence. Today we will be using this for strings to test for equality.

Here is wikipedias entry for a [Bogo-Sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogo-sort)

#Inputs & Outputs

Given a scrambled string N and another string M. You must sort N so that it matches M. After it has been sorted, it must output how many iterations  it took to complete the sorting.

##Sample Inputs & Outputs

Input:

    Bogo("lolhe","Hello")

Output:

    1456 iterations

#Bonus

For a bit of fun, the LEAST efficient algorithm wins. Check out the bogo-bogo sort, an algorithm that's designed not to succeed before the heat death of the universe

If you have designed an algorithm but it still hasn't finished sorting, if you can prove it WILL sort, you may post your proof.
