## Prompt


# [](#EasyIcon) *(Easy)*: Bytelandian Exchange 1
Bytelandian Currency is made of coins with integers on them. There is a coin for each non-negative integer (including 0). You have access to a peculiar money changing machine. If you insert a N-valued coin, with N positive, It pays back 3 coins of the value N/2,N/3 and N/4, rounded down. For example, if you insert a 19-valued coin, you get three coins worth 9, 6, and 4. If you insert a 2-valued coin, you get three coins worth 1, 0, and 0. _0-valued coins cannot be used in this machine._

One day you're bored so you insert a 7-valued coin. You get three coins back, and you then insert each of these back into the machine. You continue to do this with every positive-valued coin you get back, until finally you're left with nothing but 0-valued coins. You count them up and see you have 15 coins.

How many 0-valued coins could you get starting with a single 1000-valued coin?
