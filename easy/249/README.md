## Prompt

# Description

Let's assume I'm playing the stock market - buy low, sell high. I'm a day trader, so I want to get in and out of a stock before the day is done, and I want to time my trades so that I make the biggest gain possible.

The market has a rule that won't let me buy and sell in a pair of ticks - I have to wait for at least one tick to go buy. And obviously I can't buy in the future and sell in the past.

So, given a list of stock price ticks for the day, can you tell me what trades I should make to maximize my gain within the constraints of the market? Remember - buy low, sell high, and you can't sell before you buy.

# Input Description

You'll be given a list of stock prices as a space separated list of 2 decimal floats (dollars and cents), listed in chronological order. Example:

    19.35 19.30 18.88 18.93 18.95 19.03 19.00 18.97 18.97 18.98

# Output Description

Your program should emit the two trades in chronological order - what you think I should buy at and sell at. Example:

    18.88 19.03
