# Description

In number theory, a deficient or **deficient number** is a number n for which the sum of divisors *sigma(n)<2n*, or, equivalently, the sum of proper divisors (or aliquot sum) *s(n)<n*. The value *2n - sigma(n)* (or *n - s(n)*) is called the number's deficiency. In contrast, an **abundant number** or excessive number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number itself

As an example, consider the number 21. Its divisors are 1, 3, 7 and 21, and their sum is 32. Because 32 is less than 2 x 21, the number 21 is *deficient*. Its deficiency is 2 x 21 - 32 = 10.

~~The integer 12 is the first *abundant* number. Its proper divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 for a total of 16. The amount by which the sum exceeds the number is the abundance. The number 12 has an abundance of 4, for example.~~ The integer 12 is the first abundant number. Its divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12, and their sum is 28. Because 28 is greater than 2 x 12, the number 12 is abundant. It's abundant by is 28 - 24 = 4. (Thanks /u/Rev0lt_ for the correction.)

#  Input Description

You'll be given an integer, one per line. Example:

    18
    21
    9

#  Output Description

Your program should emit if the number if deficient, abundant (and its abundance), or neither. Example:

    18 abundant by 3
    21 deficient
    9 ~~neither~~ deficient

# Challenge Input

    111
    112
    220
    69
    134
    85

# Challenge Output

    111 ~~neither~~ deficient
    112 abundant by 24
    220 abundant by 64
    69 deficient
    134 deficient
    85 deficient

# OOPS

I had fouled up my implementation, 9 and 111 are deficient, not perfect. See http://sites.my.xs.edu.ph/connor-teh-14/aste/mathematics-asteroids/perfect-abundant-and-deficient-numbers-1-100.
