## Prompt

#Description

There is a crisis unfolding in Reddit. For many years, Redditors have continued to evolve sh\*tposting to new highs, but it seems progress has slowed in recent times. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to create a state of the art rektangular sh\*tpost generator and bring sh\*tposting into the 21st century.

Given a word, a width and a length, you must print a rektangle with the word of the given dimensions.

#Formal Inputs &amp; Outputs

##Input description

The input is a string `word`, a `width` and a `height`

##Output description

Quality rektangles. See examples. Any orientation of the rektangle is acceptable

##Examples

*  *Input*: "REKT", width=1, height=1

   *Output*:

        R E K T
        E     K
        K     E
        T K E R

* *Input*: "REKT", width=2, height=2

  *Output*:

        T K E R E K T
        K     E     K
        E     K     E
        R E K T K E R
        E     K     E
        K     E     K
        T K E R E K T

#Notes/Hints

None

#Bonus

Many fun bonuses possible - the more ways you can squeeze REKT into different shapes, the better.

* Print rektangles rotated by 45 degrees.

* Print words in other shapes (? surprise me)

* Creatively colored output? Rainbow rektangles would be glorious.
