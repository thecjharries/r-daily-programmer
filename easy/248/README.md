## Prompt

Let's build a basic paint program! Your task for today will be to create a basic paint program that can draw points, lines, and filled rectangles, then output an image file that many image viewers can read. But first, some background:

#  Netpbm Formats

PNG, GIF, JPEG, and even BMP are all image formats that are way too complex for an [Easy] challenge. Instead, we are going to be using [Netpbm formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm_format). More specifically, we will be using the PPM format, which supports 24-bit RGB color. Here's how a `.ppm` file looks (courtesy of Wikipedia):

    P3
    # The P3 means colors are in ASCII, then 3 columns and 2 rows,
    # then 255 for max color, then RGB triplets
    3 2
    255
    255   0   0     0 255   0     0   0 255
    255 255   0   255 255 255     0   0   0

Each pixel in the image is represented with 3 integers (0-255) for its Red, Green, and Blue pixel values. The above `.ppm` file gets displayed as [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Tiny6pixel.png) (zoomed in).

Everything is separated by whitespace, but what the whitespace is (and how much of it there is) doesn't matter. Comments (anything after a `#`) are also ignored. In other words, the following PPM file renders exactly the same image:

    P3 3 2 255 255 0 0 0 255 0 0 0 255 255 255 0 255 255 255 0 0 0

Lastly, note that in image processing, pixels are indexed using `(row, column)` coordinates, counting up from `(0, 0)`. Thus, in the image above, the pixel at `(0, 2)` is on row 0, column 2, which has the RGB value of `0 0 255`, or in other words, is blue.

Now that that's out of the way, let's get to painting!

# Formal Input

Your input file will contain an X/Y size for an image to create, followed by a series of commands, each on its own line. The commands each start with `point`, `line`, or `rect`, followed by a RGB color, followed by whatever arguments the command needs. Here's a sample:

    5 3
    point 0 0 255 0 0
    line 100 100 100 0 2 2 4
    rect 77 0 0 1 3 2 2

Breaking the file down line by line:

* `5 3`: The output image is 5 columns wide and 3 rows tall
* `point`: we're drawing a single point... `0 0 255`: with this RGB color (blue)... `0 0`: at this coordinate (top left)
* `line`: we're drawing a line... `100 100 100`: with this RGB color (grey)... `0 2`: from this coordinate... `2 4` to this coordinate (for oblique lines, make a "best effort" to approximate the line; no need to do any antialiasing or other fancy stuff)
* `rect`: we're drawing a rectangle... `77 0 0`: with this RGB color (dark red)... `1 3`: with its top left coordinate here... `2 2` with its sides being 2 pixels tall and 2 pixels wide

The "unpainted" background can be assumed to be black (`0 0 0`).

# Formal Output

The output PPM file for the above example should look like this (more or less, spacing notwithstanding):

    P3
    5 3
    255
    0   0   255    0   0   0      100 100 100    0   0   0      0   0   0
    0   0   0      0   0   0      0   0   0      77  0   0      77  0   0
    0   0   0      0   0   0      0   0   0      77  0   0      77  0   0

And it should render like [this](https://i.imgur.com/EaGSFdZ.png) (zoomed in).

# Challenge Input

    line 255 255 255 299 0 0 399
    rect 200 200 0 100 150 100 100
    point 0 0 0 150 200

You should get something like this: https://i.imgur.com/5F31DSE.png

# Bonus Points

If you would like more of a challenge, implement the following commands:

* `bline <R> <G> <B> <row1> <col1> <row2> <col2>` draw a line using [Bresenham's line algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm)
* `circle <R> <G> <B> <centerRow> <centerCol> <radius>`
* `ellipse <R> <G> <B> <centerRow> <centerCol> <radiusVertical> <radiusHorizontal>`
* `fill <R> <G> <B> <row> <col>` (flood fill one color starting at the given point)
* `smartfill <R> <G> <B> <row> <col> <tolerance>` (flood fill similar colors starting at the given point, filling pixels as long as the gradient distance (`sqrt( (r2-r1)^2 + (g2-g1)^2 + (b2-b1)^2)`) is less than the tolerance.
