# [3/7/2012] Challenge #19 [easy]

## Note about included text

To make things easier, I've included a static grab of [The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1661/) as of today's date. As far as I can tell, as I have not modified the download, that should be allowed within the terms of the license. If it's not, please let me know immediately and I'll remove it from the repo and `rebase` the history so it's removed from the `reflog` (ie completely removed from the repo history).

Either way, Project Gutenberg is very near and dear to my heart. If you can, you should [donate to preserving and sharing literature](https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/).

## Note about solution

For the character count, I'm only excluding the header and footer. If the purpose of the exercise is regex manipulation of text, I feel confident in my ability to do so (and adding more regex doesn't affect anything more than the time spent figuring out regex). If that's not the point, I've misunderstood the exercise.
