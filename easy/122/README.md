## Prompt


# [](#EasyIcon) *(Easy)*: Sum Them Digits
As a crude form of hashing function, Lars wants to sum the digits of a number. Then he wants to sum the digits of the result, and repeat until he have only one digit left. He learnt that this is called the [digital root](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_root) of a number, but the Wikipedia article is just confusing him.

Can you help him implement this problem in your favourite programming language?

It is possible to treat the number as a string and work with each character at a time. This is pretty slow on big numbers, though, so Lars wants you to at least try solving it with only integer calculations (the [modulo operator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation) may prove to be useful!).
