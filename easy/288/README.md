## Prompt

# Description

Alliteration is defined as "the occurrence of the same letter or sound at the beginning of adjacent or closely connected words." It's a stylistic literary device identified by the repeated sound of the first consonant in a series of multiple words, or the repetition of the same sounds or of the same kinds of sounds at the beginning of words or in stressed syllables of a phrase. The first known use of the word to refer to a literary device occurred around 1624. A simple example is "Peter Piper Picked a Peck of Pickled Peppers".

## Note on Stop Words

The following are some of the simplest English "stop words", words too common and uninformative to be of much use. In the case of Alliteration, they can come in between the words of interest (as in the Peter Piper example):

    I
    a
    about
    an
    and
    are
    as
    at
    be
    by
    com
    for
    from
    how
    in
    is
    it
    of
    on
    or
    that
    the
    this
    to
    was
    what
    when
    where
    who
    will
    with
    the

# Sample Input

You'll be given an integer on a line, telling you how many lines follow. Then on the subsequent ines, you'll be given a sentence, one per line. Example:

    3
    Peter Piper Picked a Peck of Pickled Peppers
    Bugs Bunny likes to dance the slow and simple shuffle
    You'll never put a better bit of butter on your knife

# Sample Output

Your program should emit the words from each sentence that form the group of alliteration. Example:

    Peter Piper Picked Peck Pickled Peppers
    Bugs Bunny      slow simple shuffle
    better bit butter

# Challenge Input

    8
    The daily diary of the American dream
    For the sky and the sea, and the sea and the sky
    Three grey geese in a green field grazing, Grey were the geese and green was the grazing.
    But a better butter makes a batter better.
    "His soul swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and the dead."
    Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.
    They paved paradise and put up a parking lot.
    So what we gonna have, dessert or disaster?

**EDITED** to add the word "and" to the stop word list. My bad, a mistake to omit.
