## Prompt

# [](#EasyIcon) *(Easy)*: Braille

[Braille](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille) is a writing system based on a series of raised / lowered bumps on a material, for the purpose of being read through touch rather than sight. It's an incredibly powerful reading & writing system for those who are blind / visually impaired. Though the letter system has up to 64 unique glyph, 26 are used in [English Braille](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Braille) for letters. The rest are used for numbers, words, accents, ligatures, etc.

Your goal is to read in a string of Braille characters ([using standard English Braille defined here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Braille#Alphabet)) and print off the word in standard English letters. You only have to support the 26 English letters.
