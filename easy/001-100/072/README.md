The one-dimensional simple cellular automata [Rule 110](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_110)
is the only such cellular automata currently known to be turing-complete, and many people say it is the simplest known turing-complete
system.

Implement a program capable of outputting an ascii-art representation of applying Rule 110 to some initial state.  How many iterations and what your initial state is is up to you!

You may chose to implement rule 124 instead if you like (which is the same thing, albeit backwards).

Bonus points if your program can take an arbitrary rule integer from 0-255 as input and run that rule instead!
