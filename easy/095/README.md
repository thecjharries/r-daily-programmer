## Prompt

Write a program that reads text from a file, and then outputs the text to another file but with all the lines reversed and all the words in each line reversed.

So, for instance, if you had one file called the "thetyger.txt" which contained the two first verses of William Blake's The Tyger:

    Tyger! Tyger! burning bright
    In the forests of the night,
    What immortal hand or eye
    Could frame thy fearful symmetry?

    In what distant deeps or skies
    Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
    On what wings dare he aspire?
    What the hand dare sieze the fire?

Your program would output this to "thetyger2.txt" (or whatever you want to call the file):

    fire? the sieze dare hand the What
    aspire? he dare wings what On
    eyes? thine of fire the Burnt
    skies or deeps distant what In

    symmetry? fearful thy frame Could
    eye or hand immortal What
    night, the of forests the In
    bright burning Tyger! Tyger!
