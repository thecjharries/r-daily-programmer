## Prompt

For this week my theme is bioinformatics, I hope you enjoy the taste of the field through these challenges.

# Description

DNA - deoxyribonucleic acid - is the building block of every organism. It contains information about hair color, skin tone, allergies, and more.
[It's usually visualized as a long double helix of base pairs.](http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/science/shutterstock_34693498%20copy.jpg) DNA is composed of four bases - adenine, thymine, cytosine, guanine - paired as follows: A-T and G-C.

Meaning: on one side of the strand there may be a series of bases

    A T A A G C

And on the other strand there will have to be

    T A T T C G

It is your job to generate one side of the DNA strand and output the two DNA strands. Your program should take a DNA sequence as input and return the complementary strand.

# Input

    A A T G C C T A T G G C

# Output
    A A T G C C T A T G G C
    T T A C G G A T A C C G

# Extra Challenge

Three base pairs make a codon. These all have different names based on what combination of the base pairs you have. A handy table can be found [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_codon_table).
The string of codons starts with an ATG (Met) codon ends when a STOP codon is hit.

For this part of the challenge, you should implement functionality for translating the DNA to a protein sequence based on the codons, recalling that every generated DNA strand starts with a Met codon and ends with a STOP codon. Your program should take a DNA sequence and emit the translated protein sequence, complete with a STOP at the terminus.

#Input

    A T G T T T C G A G G C T A A

#Output

    A T G T T T C G A G G C T A A
    Met Phe Arg Gly STOP
