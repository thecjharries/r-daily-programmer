## Prompt

#Description
You're a well known web-dev with far too much confidence, you mistakingly agreed to complete too many projects in too little a timeframe. In order to fix this, you devise a program that will automatically write all of the HTML for you!

But first, you'll need to program it.

#Formal Inputs & Outputs

##Input description

On standard console input you should be prompted to enter a paragraph.

##Output description

Once your paragraph has been entered, it should be saved as a valid HTML file and opened in your default brower to display the results

#Sample Inputs & Outputs

##Input

    "Enter your paragraph:"
    "This is my paragraph entry"

##Output
(this is the expected content of the .html file)

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title></title>
        </head>

        <body>
            <p>This is my paragraph entry</p>
        </body>
    </html>

#Bonus

Implement a good looking default CSS style-sheet that also gets automatically generated.
