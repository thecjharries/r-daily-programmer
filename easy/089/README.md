## Prompt

For today's challenge, you should calculate some simple statistical values based on a list of values. Given [this data set](http://pastebin.com/vqzTrVK2), write functions that will calculate:

* [The mean value](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean)
* [The variance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance)
* [The standard deviation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation)


Obviously, many programming languages and environments have standard functions for these (this problem is one of the few that is *really* easy to solve in Excel!), but you are not allowed to use those! The point of this problem is to write the functions yourself.

* Thanks to [Cosmologicon](http://www.reddit.com/user/Cosmologicon) for suggesting this problem at /r/dailyprogrammer_ideas!
