## Prompt

# Description

This challenge is about finding minimums/maximums.  The challenge consists of two similar word problems where you will be asked to maximize/minimize a target value.

To make this more of a programming challenge rather than using programming as a calculator, I encourage you to try to find a generic minimize/maximize function rather than just calculating the answer directly.

# Challenge

1. A piece of wire 100 cm in length is bent into the shape of a sector of a circle.  Find the angle of the sector that maximizes the area A of the sector.  [sector_image](https://i.imgur.com/M7J2Ilm.png)

2. A and B are towns 20km and 30km from a straight stretch of river 100km long.  Water is pumped from a point P on the river by pipelines to both towns.  Where should P be located to minimize the total length of pipe AP + PB? [river_image](https://i.imgur.com/efzP0Ad.png)

# Challenge Outputs

The accuracy of these answers will depending how much precision you use when calculating them.

1. ~114.6
2. ~40
