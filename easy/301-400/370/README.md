## Prompt

The Universal Product Code (UPC-A) is a bar code used in many parts of the world. The bars encode a 12-digit number used to identify a product for sale, for example:

    042100005264

The 12th digit (4 in this case) is a redundant check digit, used to catch errors. Using some simple calculations, a scanner can determine, given the first 11 digits, what the check digit must be for a valid code. (Check digits have previously appeared in this subreddit: see [Intermediate 30](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/red6f/3262012_challenge_30_intermediate/) and [Easy 197](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/2s7ezp/20150112_challenge_197_easy_isbn_validator/).) UPC's check digit is calculated as follows (taken from Wikipedia):

1. Sum the digits at odd-numbered positions (1st, 3rd, 5th, ..., 11th). *If you use 0-based indexing, this is the even-numbered positions (0th, 2nd, 4th, ... 10th).*
2. Multiply the result from step 1 by 3.
3. Take the sum of digits at even-numbered positions (2nd, 4th, 6th, ..., 10th) in the original number, and add this sum to the result from step 2.
4. Find the result from step 3 modulo 10 (i.e. the remainder, when divided by 10) and call it *M*.
5. If *M* is 0, then the check digit is 0; otherwise the check digit is 10 - *M*.

For example, given the first 11 digits of a UPC `03600029145`, you can compute the check digit like this:

1. Sum the odd-numbered digits (0 + 6 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 5 = 14).
2. Multiply the result by 3 (14 Ã— 3 = 42).
3. Add the even-numbered digits (42 + (3 + 0 + 0 + 9 + 4) = 58).
4. Find the result modulo 10 (58 divided by 10 is 5 remainder 8, so *M* = 8).
5. If *M* is not 0, subtract *M* from 10 to get the check digit (10 - *M* = 10 - 8 = 2).

So the check digit is `2`, and the complete UPC is `036000291452`.

# Challenge

Given an 11-digit number, find the 12th digit that would make a valid UPC. You may treat the input as a string if you prefer, whatever is more convenient. If you treat it as a number, you may need to consider the case of leading 0's to get up to 11 digits. That is, an input of `12345` would correspond to a UPC start of `00000012345`.

# Examples

    upc(4210000526) => 4
    upc(3600029145) => 2
    upc(12345678910) => 4
    upc(1234567) => 0

Also, if you live in a country that uses UPCs, you can generate all the examples you want by picking up store-bought items or packages around your house. Find anything with a bar code on it: if it has 12 digits, it's probably a UPC. Enter the first 11 digits into your program and see if you get the 12th.
