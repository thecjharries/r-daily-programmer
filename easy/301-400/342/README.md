## Prompt

#Description

Today's challenge is to divide two polynomials. For example, [long division](http://www.purplemath.com/modules/polydiv3.htm) can be implemented.

Display the quotient and remainder obtained upon division.

# Input Description

Let the user enter two polynomials. Feel free to accept it as you wish to. Divide the first polynomial by the second. For the sake of clarity, I'm writing whole expressions in the challenge input, but by all means, feel free to accept the degree and all the coefficients of a polynomial.

# Output Description

Display the remainder and quotient obtained.

#Challenge Input

1:

> 4x^3 + 2x^2 - 6x + 3

> x - 3

2:

> 2x^4  - 9x^3 + 21x^2 - 26x + 12

> 2x - 3

3:

> 10x^4 - 7x^2 -1

> x^2 - x + 3

#Challenge Output

1:
> Quotient: 4x^2 + 14x + 36 Remainder: 111

2:
> Quotient: x^3 - 3x^2 +6x - 4 Remainder: 0

3:
> Quotient: 10x^2 + 10x - 27 Remainder: -57x + 80

# Bonus

Go for long division and display the whole process, like one would on pen and paper.
