## Prompt

#Description

Numbers can be written in many kind of bases.

Normally we use `base 10`, wich is the decimal notation, for our numbers. In modern computerscience we use `base 16` (hexadecimal) a lot, and beneath that we have `base 2` (binary).

Given a number you can't tell what base it is, but you can tell what base it isn't from. E.g.: `1` exists in all bases, but `2` does not exist in `base 2`. It does exist in `base 3` and so on.

#Formal Inputs & Outputs

You will be given a number and you have to print the smallest base possible to wich it can belong and it's equivalent in `base 10`

##Input description

The numbers to test

    1
    21
    ab3
    ff

##Output description

The smallest base it belongs to plus the value in `base 10`

    base 2 => 1
    base 3 => 7
    base 12 => 1575
    base 16 => 255

#Notes/Hints

For more info on numeral systems, you can start here [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_system)

For those new with bases. The letters translate to a higher value then `9`, and because `10` exists out of 2 digits, they replace it with a letter.

This is the translation you need for this challenge

Digit | Value
---|---
a | 10
b | 11
c | 12
d | 13
e | 14
f | 15


#Bonus

Print out all the decimal values for every base starting from the minimum till `base 16`.

##Input

    21

##Output

    base 3 => 7
    base 4 => 9
    base 5 => 11
    base 6 => 13
    base 7 => 15
    base 8 => 17
    base 9 => 19
    base 10 => 21
    base 11 => 23
    base 12 => 25
    base 13 => 27
    base 14 => 29
    base 15 => 31
    base 16 => 33


##Bonus inputs:

    1
    21
    ab3
    ff

#Bonus 2
Make sure your program handles `0`.

The minimum base for `0` is `base 1` and it's value `0`. As you might expect...
