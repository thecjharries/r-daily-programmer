## Prompt

The easy challenge today is to implement the famous [Vigenère cipher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher). The Wikipedia article explains well how it works, but here's a short description anyway:

You take a message that you want to encrypt, for instance "THECAKEISALIE" (lets assume that all characters are upper-case and there are no spaces in the messages, for the sake of simplicity), and a key you want to encrypt it with, for instance "GLADOS". You then write the message with the key repeated over it, like this:

    GLADOSGLADOSG
    THECAKEISALIE

The key is repeated as often as is needed to cover the entire message.

Now, one by one, each letter of the key is "added" to the letter of the clear-text to produce the cipher-text. That is, if A = 0, B = 1, C = 2, etc, then E + G = K (because E = 4 and G = 6, and 4 + 6 = 10, and K = 10). If the sum is larger than 25 (i.e. larger than Z), it starts from the beginning, so S + K = C (i.e. 18 + 10 = 28, and 28 - 26 is equal to 2, which is C).

For a full chart of how characters combine to form new characters, see [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Vigen%C3%A8re_square_shading.svg)

The cipher text then becomes:

    GLADOSGLADOSG
    THECAKEISALIE
    -------------
    ZSEFOCKTSDZAK

Write funtions to both encrypt and decrypt messages given the right key.

As an optional bonus, decrypt the following message, which has been encrypted with a word that I've used in this post:

As an additional challenge, attempt to pronounce "Vigenère" properly. I think it's like "Viche-en-ere", but I'm not entirely sure.
