## Prompt

# Description

A [_garland word_](http://blog.vivekhaldar.com/post/89763722591/garland-words) is one that starts and ends with the same N letters in the same order, for some N greater than 0, but less than the length of the word. I'll call the maximum N for which this works the garland word's _degree_. For instance, "onion" is a garland word of degree 2, because its first 2 letters "on" are the same as its last 2 letters. The name "garland word" comes from the fact that you can make chains of the word in this manner:

    onionionionionionionionionionion...

Today's challenge is to write a function `garland` that, given a lowercase word, returns the degree of the word if it's a garland word, and 0 otherwise.

# Examples

    garland("programmer") -> 0
    garland("ceramic") -> 1
    garland("onion") -> 2
    garland("alfalfa") -> 4

# Optional challenges

1. Given a garland word, print out the chain using that word, as with "onion" above. You can make it as long or short as you like, even infinite.
1. Find the largest degree of any garland word in the [enable1 English word list](https://code.google.com/p/dotnetperls-controls/downloads/detail?name=enable1.txt).
1. Find a word list for some other language, and see if you can find a language with a garland word with a higher degree.
