## Prompt

# [](#EasyIcon) _(Easy)_: Blackjack Checker

[Blackjack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack) is a very common card game, where the primary aim is to pick up cards until your hand has a higher value than everyone else but is less than or equal to 21. This challenge will look at the outcome of the game, rather than playing the game itself.

The value of a hand is determined by the cards in it.

* Numbered cards are worth their number - eg. a 6 of Hearts is worth 6.

* Face cards (JQK) are worth 10.

* Ace can be worth 1 or 11.

The person with the highest valued hand wins, with one exception - if a person has 5 cards in their hand and it has any value 21 or less, then they win automatically. This is called a 5 card trick.

If the value of your hand is worth over 21, you are 'bust', and automatically lose.

Your challenge is, given a set of players and their hands, print who wins (or if it is a tie game.)

## Input Description

First you will be given a number, **N**. This is the number of players in the game.

Next, you will be given a further **N** lines of input. Each line contains the name of the player and the cards in their hand, like so:

    Bill: Ace of Diamonds, Four of Hearts, Six of Clubs

Would have a value of 21 (or 11 if you wanted, as the Ace could be 1 or 11.)

## Output Description

Print the winning player. If two or more players won, print "Tie".

# Example Inputs and Outputs

## Example Input 1

    3
    Alice: Ace of Diamonds, Ten of Clubs

    Alice has won!

## Example Input 2

    4
    Alice: Ace of Diamonds, Ten of Clubs
    Bob: Three of Hearts, Six of Spades, Seven of Spades
    Chris: Ten of Hearts, Three of Diamonds, Jack of Clubs

## Example Output 2

    David has won with a 5-card trick!

# Notes

Here's a tip to simplify things. If your programming language supports it, create enumerations (`enum`) for card ranks and card suits, and create structures/classes (`struct`/`class`) for the cards themselves - see [this example C# code](https://github.com/DropTableSpoon/Challenge170Easy/blob/master/Challenge170Easy/Cards/Card.cs).

For resources on using structs and enums if you haven't used them before (in C#): [structs](https://duckduckgo.com/l/?kh=-1&uddg=http%3A%2F%2Fmsdn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Flibrary%2Fsaxz13w4.aspx), [enums](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/sbbt4032.aspx).

You may want to re-use some code from your solution to [this challenge](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/24r50l/) where appropriate.
