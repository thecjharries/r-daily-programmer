A word ladder is a sequence of words made by changing one letter at a time. For example:

    cold → cord → card → ward → warm

Given a word, list all the words that can appear next to it in a word ladder, using [this list of 3,807 four-letter words](http://pastebin.com/zY4Xt7iB). Sample input:

    puma

Sample output:

    duma
    pima
    puja
    pula
    pump
    puna
    pupa

How many words from the list can appear next to the word `best` in a word ladder?

__Bonus 1:__ One word in the list has 33 other words that can appear next to it. What is this word?

__Bonus 2:__ How many different words can be reached, starting from `best`, in 3 or fewer steps?
