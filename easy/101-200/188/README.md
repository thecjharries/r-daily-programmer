## Prompt

#Description:

iso 8601 standard for dates tells us the proper way to do an extended day is yyyy-mm-dd

* yyyy = year
* mm = month
* dd = day

A company's database has become polluted with mixed date formats. They could be one of 6 different formats

* yyyy-mm-dd
* mm/dd/yy
* mm#yy#dd
* dd\*mm\*yyyy
* (month word) dd, yy
* (month word) dd, yyyy

(month word) can be: Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec

Note if is yyyy it is a full 4 digit year. If it is yy then it is only the last 2 digits of the year. Years only go between 1950-2049.

#Input:

You will be given 1000 dates to correct.

#Output:

You must output the dates to the proper iso 8601 standard of yyyy-mm-dd

#Posting Solutions:

Please do not post your 1000 dates converted. If you must use a gist or link to another site. Or just show a sampling

#Challenge Idea:

Thanks to all the people pointing out the iso standard  for dates in last week's intermediate challenge. Not only did it inspire today's easy challenge but help give us a weekly topic. You all are awesome :)
