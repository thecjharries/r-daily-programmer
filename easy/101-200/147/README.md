## Prompt

# [](#EasyIcon) *(Easy)*: Sport Points

You must write code that verifies the awarded points for a fictional sport are valid. This sport is a simplification of [American Football](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football#Scoring) scoring rules. This means that the score values must be any logical combination of the following four rewards:

+ 6 points for a "touch-down"
+ 3 points for a "field-goal"
+ 1 point for an "extra-point"; can only be rewarded *after* a touch-down. Mutually-exclusive with "two-point conversion"
+ 2 points for a "two-point conversion"; can only be rewarded *after* a touch-down. Mutually-exclusive with "extra-point"

A valid score could be 7, which can come from a single "touch-down" and then an "extra-point". Another example could be 6, from either a single "touch-down" or two "field-goals". 4 is not a valid score, since it cannot be formed by any well-combined rewards.
