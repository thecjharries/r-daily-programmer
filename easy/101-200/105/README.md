# [10/20/2012] Challenge #105 [Easy] (Word unscrambler)

## Note

There isn't a runner function in the Go for this exercise. I already didn't complete it properly by returning all possible matches (which was much easier imo). All the pieces are there; I just can't be bothered to put them together.

## Prompt

Given a wordlist of your choosing, make a program to unscramble scrambled words from that list. For sanity and brevity, disregard any words which have ambiguous unscramlings, such as "dgo" unscrambling to both "dog" and "god."

**Input**:

A file which contains scrambled words and a wordlist to match it against

**Output**:

The unscrambled words which match the scrambled ones
