## Prompt

# [](#EasyIcon) _(Easy)_: Trigonometric Triangle Trouble, pt. 1

A triangle on a flat plane is described by its angles and side lengths, and you don't need to be given all of the angles and side lengths to work out the rest. In this challenge, you'll be working with **right-angled triangles only**.

[Here's a representation of how this challenge will describe a triangle](http://i.imgur.com/qtHozmc.png). Each side-length is a **lower-case** letter, and the angle opposite each side is an **upper-case** letter. For the purposes of this challenge, the angle C will always be the right-angle. Your challenge is, using basic trigonometry and given an appropriate number of values for the angles or side lengths, to find the rest of the values.

# Formal Inputs and Outputs

## Input Description

On the console, you will be given a number **N**. You will then be given **N** lines, expressing **some** details of a triangle in the format below, where all angles are in degrees; the input data will always give enough information and will describe a valid triangle. Note that, depending on your language of choice, a conversion from degrees to radians may be needed to use trigonometric functions such as *sin*, *cos* and *tan*.

## Output Description

You must print out **all** of the details of the triangle in the same format as above.

# Sample Inputs & Outputs

## Sample Input

	3
	a=3
	b=4
	C=90

## Sample Output

	a=3
	b=4
	c=5
	A=36.87
	B=53.13
	C=90

# Tips & Notes

There are 4 useful trigonometric identities you may find very useful.

* [Pythagoreas' Theorem](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?r%5E2&plus;s%5E2%3Dh%5E2), where *h* is the side length opposite the right-angle and *r* and *s* are any 2 other sides.

* [3 Trigonometric Ratios](http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometry#Trigonometric_Ratios)

Part 2 will be submitted on the 2nd of May. To make it easier to complete Part 2, write your code in such a way that it can be extended later on. Use good programming practices (as always!).
