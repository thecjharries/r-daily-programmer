## Prompt

# [](#EasyIcon) *(Easy)*: Greatest Common Divisor

The [Greatest Common Divisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of a given set of integers is the greatest integer that can divide these integers without any remainder. From Wikipedia, take a look at this example: for the integers 8 and 12, the highest integer that divides them without remainder is 4.

Your goal is to write a program that takes two integers, and returns the greatest common divisor. You may pick any algorithm or approach you prefer, though a good starting point is [Euclid's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor#Using_Euclid.27s_algorithm).
