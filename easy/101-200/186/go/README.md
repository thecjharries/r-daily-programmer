## Note

This isn't a well-defined exercise. It's a neat story, I guess. The things the story tells you to do aren't exactly concrete, though. They also really expect a shell scripting language. Normally these exercises do not force a specific set of languages.

I threw together a very simple command runner and an example command. If you look at the comments, you'll see that no one (bash or PowerShell) agree on interpretation of the prompts, so I'm calling it a day.
