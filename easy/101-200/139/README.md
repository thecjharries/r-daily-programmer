## Prompt

# [](#EasyIcon) *(Easy)*: Pangrams

[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangram) has a great definition for Pangrams: "*A pangram or holoalphabetic sentence for a given alphabet is a sentence using every letter of the alphabet at least once.*" A good example is the English-language sentence "[The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_quick_brown_fox_jumps_over_the_lazy_dog)"; note how all 26 English-language letters are used in the sentence.

Your goal is to implement a program that takes a series of strings (one per line) and prints either True (the given string is a pangram), or False (it is not).

**Bonus:** On the same line as the "True" or "False" result, print the number of letters used, starting from 'A' to 'Z'. The format should match the following example based on the above sentence:

    a: 1, b: 1, c: 1, d: 1, e: 3, f: 1, g: 1, h: 2, i: 1, j: 1, k: 1, l: 1, m: 1, n: 1, o: 4, p: 1, q: 1, r: 2, s: 1, t: 2, u: 2, v: 1, w: 1, x: 1, y: 1, z: 1

# Formal Inputs & Outputs
## Input Description

On standard console input, you will be given a single integer on the first line of input. This integer represents the number of lines you will then receive, each being a string of alpha-numeric characters ('a'-'z', 'A'-'Z', '0'-'9') as well as spaces and [period](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period_(punctuation\)).

## Output Description

For each line of input, print either "True" if the given line was a pangram, or "False" if not.
