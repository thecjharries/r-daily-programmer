## Prompt

If you haven't gathered from the title, the challenge here is to go from decimal notation -> scientific notation.  For those that don't know, scientific notation allows for a decimal less than ten, greater than zero, and a power of ten to be multiplied.

For example: 239487 would be 2.39487 x 10^5

And .654 would be 6.54 x 10^-1

_____________

Bonus Points:

* Have you program randomly generate the number that you will translate.

* Go both ways (i.e., given 0.935 x 10^3, output 935.)

Good luck, and have fun!
