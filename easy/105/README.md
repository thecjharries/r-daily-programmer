## Prompt

Given a wordlist of your choosing, make a program to unscramble scrambled words from that list. For sanity and brevity, disregard any words which have ambiguous unscramlings, such as "dgo" unscrambling to both "dog" and "god."

**Input**:

A file which contains scrambled words and a wordlist to match it against

**Output**:

The unscrambled words which match the scrambled ones
