# [4/25/2012] Challenge #44 [easy]

## Note

Instead of adding the regex to do word count, I did character count. The two are **not** equivalent but I'm lazy and showing that I can do one more regex evaluation doesn't add much to the task. The logic changes in `findLargestSentence`; I'd probably add a `countWordsInSentence` function to do it.

## Prompt

Write a program that divides up some input text into sentences and then determines which sentence in the input has the most words. Print out the sentence with the most words and the number of words that are in it. Optionally, also print out all words in that sentence that are longer than 4 characters.

Sentences can end in periods, exclamation points and question marks, but not colons or semi-colons.

If you need something to input, try Shylock's famous speech from Shakespeare's *The Merchant of Venice*:

>If it will feed nothing else, it will
feed my revenge. He hath disgrac'd me and hind'red me half a
million; laugh'd at my losses, mock'd at my gains, scorned my
nation, thwarted my bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine
enemies. And what's his reason? I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes?
Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections,
passions, fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons,
subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed
and cooled by the same winter and summer, as a Christian is? If
you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh?
If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we
not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you
in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility?
Revenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance
be by Christian example? Why, revenge. The villainy you teach me
I will execute; and it shall go hard but I will better the
instruction.
