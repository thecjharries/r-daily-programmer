Your challenge today is to write a program that can draw a checkered grid (like a chessboard) to any dimension. For instance, a 3 by 8 board might look like this:

    *********************************
    *   *###*   *###*   *###*   *###*
    *   *###*   *###*   *###*   *###*
    *   *###*   *###*   *###*   *###*
    *********************************
    *###*   *###*   *###*   *###*   *
    *###*   *###*   *###*   *###*   *
    *###*   *###*   *###*   *###*   *
    *********************************
    *   *###*   *###*   *###*   *###*
    *   *###*   *###*   *###*   *###*
    *   *###*   *###*   *###*   *###*
    *********************************

Yours doesn't have to look like mine, you can make it look any way you want (now that I think of it, mine looks kinda bad, actually). Also try to make it scalable, so that if you want to make a 2 by 5 board, but with bigger squares, it would print out:

    *******************************
    *     *#####*     *#####*     *
    *     *#####*     *#####*     *
    *     *#####*     *#####*     *
    *     *#####*     *#####*     *
    *     *#####*     *#####*     *
    *******************************
    *#####*     *#####*     *#####*
    *#####*     *#####*     *#####*
    *#####*     *#####*     *#####*
    *#####*     *#####*     *#####*
    *#####*     *#####*     *#####*
    *******************************

Have fun!
