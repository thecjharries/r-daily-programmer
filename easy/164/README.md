## Prompt

##Description

You have just been hired by the company 'Super-Corp 5000' and they require you to be up to speed on a new programming language you haven't yet tried.

It is your task to familiarise yourself with this language following this criteria:

* The language must be one you've shown interest for in the past
* You must not have had past experience with the language

In order to Impress HR and convince the manager to hire you, you must complete 5 small tasks. You will definitely be hired if you complete the bonus task.

##Input & Output

These 5 tasks are:

* Output 'Hello World' to the console.

* Return an array of the first 100 numbers that are divisible by 3 and 5.

* Create a program that verifies if a word is an anagram of another word.

* Create a program that removes a specificed letter from a word.

* Sum all the elements of an array

All output will be the expected output of these processes which can be verified in your normal programming language.

##Bonus

Implement a bubble-sort.

##Note

Don't use a language you've had contact with before, otherwise this will be very easy. The idea is to learn a new language that you've been curious about.
