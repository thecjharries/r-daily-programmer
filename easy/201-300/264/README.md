## Prompt

# Description

Keeping your code clean is one thing. But keeping it sorted is a whole other thing...

Today you will get sorted `C++` coded (literaly) like this:


      std::cout << "Hello world!" << std::endl;
    }
    #include <iostream>
    int main () {

And you have to unsort it into this:

    #include <iostream>

    int main () {
      std::cout << "Hello world!" << std::endl;
    }

There are some rules you have to follow:

- Lines with `#include` always shows on top.
- Indentation consists out of 2 spaces
- Whitespace lines are not obliged
- variables have to be defined before used.
- Every `{` must have a `}` on the same indentation level
- Lines that belong to the same method and are of the same indentation, are in order.

# Input Description

You'll be given a program that was sorted



        sum = i + sum;
      {
      }
      int sum = 0
      for (int i = 0; i <= 100; ++i)
      std::cout << sum;
      return 0;
    {
    }
    #include <iostream>
    int main()


# Output Description

Your program should unsort the lines to something compilable by the compiler:

    #include <iostream>

    int main()
    {
      int sum = 0;
      for (int i = 0; i <= 100; ++i)
      {
        sum = i + sum;
      }
      std::cout << sum;
      return 0;
    }

# Challenge Input

        sum = i + sum;
      {
      }
      int sum = 0
      for (int i = 0; i <= 100; ++i)
      std::cout << sum;
      return 0;
    {
    }
    #include <iostream>
    int main()

# Challenge Output

    #include <iostream>
    int main()
    {
      int sum = 0;
      for (int i = 0; i <= 100; ++i)
      {
        sum = i + sum;
      }
      std::cout << sum;
      return 0;
    }

# Bonus

In C++ a method must be defined before you can use it.
That's why when having multiple methods you must sort those methods on top first.

When you have multiple possibilities, you can sort the methods alpabeticly

# Input

            sum += f(x);
        {
        }
        return ( 1.0 / ( y * y) );
        unsigned int start = 1;
        unsigned int end = 1000;
        double sum = 0;
        for( unsigned int x = start; x <= end; ++x )
        std::cout << "Sum of f(x) from " << start << " to " << end << " is " << sum << std::endl;
        return 0;
    {
    {
    }
    }
    #include <iostream>
    double f(double y)
    int main()

# Output

    #include <iostream>

    double f(double y)
    {
        return ( 1.0 / ( y * y) );
    }

    int main()
    {
        unsigned int start = 1;
        unsigned int end = 1000;
        double sum = 0;

        for( unsigned int x = start; x <= end; ++x )
        {
            sum += f(x);
        }
        std::cout << "Sum of f(x) from " << start << " to " << end << " is " << sum << std::endl;
        return 0;
    }
