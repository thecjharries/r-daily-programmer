## Prompt

#Description
All great things start with something small. Sometimes people [don't even realise what goes into making a 'small' thing](http://rampantgames.com/blog/?p=7745).

A popular story is linked above about a group of graphics programmers who create a rendering engine in some amount of time. After some time HR came to see what the programmers had accomplished. They responded by showing a black triangle on a tv.

HR was less than impressed (understandle for a non techie) but it goes to show the natural evolution of a program. What they didn't realise is that the programmers have created their base engine and can now easily add and extend on top of it.

Maybe you can follow similar steps?
