[Unconditional Loan Income](http://www.naturalfinance.net/2016/02/unconditional-loan-income-ubi-pilot.html) is a private or public (social) program that uses "soft loans" whose only repayment obligation is a royalty on future income.

Special considerations for core/simple test are:

1. An automatic clawback (to repay previous loans) of new social loans takes place when the total outstanding balance exceeds a threshold cap.
2. A higher royalty rate applies when recipient's age is 65 or higher, and applies for both income and new ULI loans.

When repayments are made, the first loan in queue (first loan taken out) is repaid with the payment.  Special considerations **for bonus** are:

1. once repayments for a loan exceed (or equal) the principal amount, interest stops accruing,
2. there is a total repayment cap of 2x the principal for any loan (once cap is reached,
3. there may be a social guarantor for the loans, which will repay up to the loan principal upon the borrower's death.

#sample test
Given an interest rate, annual loan amount, starting age, royalty rate under age 65, clawback balance trigger, royalty rate over 65 and an annual (assumed) income stream, calculate total repayments and profit or loss:
