## Prompt

# **Description:**

We  are given a list of numbers in a "short-hand" range notation where only the significant part of the next number is written because we know the numbers are always increasing (ex. "1,3,7,2,4,1" represents [1, 3, 7, 12, 14, 21]). Some people use different separators for their ranges (ex. "1-3,1-2", "1:3,1:2", "1..3,1..2" represent the same numbers [1, 2, 3, 11, 12]) and they sometimes specify a third digit for the range step (ex. "1:5:2" represents [1, 3, 5]).

**NOTE:** For this challenge range limits are always inclusive.

Our job is to return a list of the complete numbers.

The possible separators are: ["-", ":", ".."]


# **Input:**

You'll be given strings in the "short-hand" range notation

    "1,3,7,2,4,1"
    "1-3,1-2"
    "1:5:2"
    "104-2"
    "104..02"
    "545,64:11"

# **Output:**

You should output a string of all the numbers separated by a space

    "1 3 7 12 14 21"
    "1 2 3 11 12"
    "1 3 5"
    "104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112"
    "104 105 106...200 201 202" # truncated for simplicity
    "545 564 565 566...609 610 611" # truncated for simplicity


#Finally

Have a good challenge idea, like /u/izxle did?

Consider submitting it to /r/dailyprogrammer_ideas

#Update

As /u/SeverianLies pointed out, it is unclear if the `-` is a seperator or a sign.

For this challenge we work with only positive natural numbers.
