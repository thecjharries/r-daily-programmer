## Prompt

I see that no [Hard] challenge was posted last week, the moderator had some challenges with getting away. Hopefully an [Easy] challenge makes up for it.

# Description

A vampire number *v* is a number *v=xy* with an even number *n* of digits formed by multiplying a pair of *n*/2-digit numbers (where the digits are taken from the original number in any order) *x* and *y* together. Pairs of trailing zeros are not allowed. If *v* is a vampire number, then *x* and *y* are called its "fangs."

**EDIT FOR CLARITY** Vampire numbers were original 2 two-digit number (fangs) that multiplied to form a four digit number. We can extend this concept to an arbitrary number of two digit numbers. For this challenge we'll work with three two-digit numbers (the fangs) to create six digit numbers with the same property - we conserve the digits we have on both sides of the equation.

# Input Description

Two digits on one line indicating *n*, the number of digits in the number to factor and find if it is a vampire number, and *m*, the number of fangs. Example:

    4 2

# Output Description

A list of all vampire numbers of *n* digits, you should emit the number and its factors (or "fangs"). Example:

    1260=21*60
    1395=15*93
    1435=41*35
    1530=51*30
    1827=87*21
    2187=27*81
    6880=86*80

# Challenge Input

    6 3

# Challenge Input Solution

    114390=41*31*90
    121695=21*61*95
    127428=21*74*82
    127680=21*76*80
    127980=20*79*81
    137640=31*74*60
    163680=66*31*80
    178920=71*90*28
    197925=91*75*29
    198450=81*49*50
    247680=40*72*86
    294768=46*72*89
    376680=73*60*86
    397575=93*75*57
    457968=56*94*87
    479964=74*94*69
    498960=99*84*60

**NOTE**: removed `139500=31*90*50` as an invalid solution - both 90 and 50 in zeros. Thanks to /u/mips32.
