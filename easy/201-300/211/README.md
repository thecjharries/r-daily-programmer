## Prompt

#Description

If computer programmers had a "patron musician" (if such a thing even exists), it would surely be the great [Shirley Ellis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Ellis). It is my opinion that in the history of music, not song has ever come closer to replicating the experience of programming as her 1964 novelty hit [The Name Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MJLi5_dyn0). In the lyrics of that song she lays out quite an elegant and fun algorithm for making a rhyme out of anybody's name. The lyrics are almost like sung pseudo-code!

Your challenge today will be to implement a computer program that can play Ms. Ellis' Name Game. You will recieve a name for input, and output the rhyme for that name.

It should be noted that while the rhyming algorithm is very elegant and easy for humans to follow, Ms. Ellis description is not *quite* rigorous. For instance, there's an extra rule that she doesn't mention that only applies when names start with a vowel (such as "Arnold"), and it's not quite clear exactly what you should do when the names start with M, F or B. You will have to fill in the blanks as best you can on your own. If you're not sure how a specific rule goes, implement what sounds best to you.

You should primarily refer to the song for instructions, but I've includeded the relevant lyrics here:

> Come on everybody!
> I say now let's play a game
> I betcha I can make a rhyme out of anybody's name
>
> The first letter of the name, I treat it like it wasn't there
> But a "B" or an "F" or an "M" will appear
> And then I say "bo", add a "B", then I say the name
> and "Bonana fanna" and a "fo"
>
> And then I say the name again with an "F" very plain
> and a "fee fy" and a "mo"
> And then I say the name again with an "M" this time
> and there isn't any name that I can't rhyme
>
> But if the first two letters are ever the same,
> I drop them both and say the name like
>
> Bob, Bob drop the B's "Bo-ob"
> For Fred, Fred drop the F's "Fo-red"
> For Mary, Mary drop the M's Mo-ary
> That's the only rule that is contrary.
