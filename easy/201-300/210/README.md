## Prompt

#Description:

In this modern fast paced time of the internet it is a busy place for hardworking unsigned integers (lets just call them ints) Believe it or not these ints love to date and hook up. But they don't always get along.

Computer scientists have discovered 32 levels of compatibility. By comparing the binary value of ints we can develop a percentage of compatibility. (these unsigned integers need 32 bits to store in memory)

For today's challenge you will be given 2 unsigned ints who might be a match. You will compute a percentage of compatibility by comparing the binary value of each unsigned ints to each other. For every bit (1 or 0) in common they generate 1 match point. The max will be 32 the lowest will be 0. You then display the percentage of compatibility.

Also as a service to the unsigned ints you will list the avoid number. This is the number that is the pure opposite of that number (in binary)

#Finding Compatibility:

So for my example I am using 8 bit integers. You must do this for all 32 bits of an integer. But I am using 8 bit examples to keep it simple.

We are gonna compare 1 and 2

     1 in binary is 0000 0001
     2 in binary is 0000 0010

If you compare each bit place with each number you find that they have 6 bits in common. (From left to right -- the first 6 bits are all 0 and so the same bit and so that is 6 match points)

the last 2 bits are not the same. They are different.

Therefore 1 and 2 have 6 out of 8 match points. For a compatibility score of 75%

The most compatible numbers will be the same number as all the bits match perfectly. (We are all most compatible with ourselves the most)

So taking 1 in binary (0000 0001) the complete opposite number would have to be (1111 1110) or 254. 1 and 254 should not be in the same data structure together ever.

#Input:

     2 unsigned Integers x and y

#Output

     % of compatibility
     x should avoid (x's opposite)
     y should avoid (y's opposite)


#Example:

This is an 8 bit example - for your challenge you will be using 32 bit unsigned ints.

100 42

     100 in binary is 0110 0100
      42 in binary is 0010 1010

Comparing the bits we see that they have 4 match points. 50% compatible.

     the opposite of 100 in binary is 1001 1011 or (155)
     the opposite of 42 in binary is 1101 0101 or (213)

So our output should be

     50% Compatibility
     100 should avoid 155
     42 should avoid 213

Okay so not a great match but at intHarmony.com but we have done our job.
