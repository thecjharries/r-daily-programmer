## Prompt

# [](#EasyIcon) *(Easy)*: Sum-the-Digits, Part II

Given a well-formed (non-empty, fully valid) string of digits, let the integer N be the sum of digits. Then, given this integer N, turn it into a string of digits. Repeat this process until you only have one digit left. Simple, clean, and easy: focus on writing this as cleanly as possible in your preferred programming language.

*Author: nint22. This challenge is particularly easy, so don't worry about looking for crazy corner-cases or weird exceptions. This challenge is as up-front as it gets :-) Good luck, have fun!*

# Formal Inputs & Outputs
## Input Description

On standard console input, you will be given a string of digits. This string will not be of zero-length and will be guaranteed well-formed (will always have digits, and nothing else, in the string).

## Output Description

You must take the given string, sum the digits, and then convert this sum to a string and print it out onto standard console. Then, you must repeat this process again and again until you only have one digit left.
