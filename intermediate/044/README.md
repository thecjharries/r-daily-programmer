*The only winning move is not to play* - Joshua

Let's take our minds off this Global Thermonuclear War business, and lets play som Tic-Tac-Toe! Make a Tic-Tac-Toe playing AI and have it either play games against you or against itself.

If it plays against you, it should always win or draw, regardless of who goes first. If it plays against itself, it should always draw.

Here's how the beginning of a game might look in a terminal window (this is just a suggestion, yours can look however you want it to look, you could even make a GUI if you really wanted to):
