## Prompt

On December 7, 2011, Neil deGrasse Tyson tweeted:


Need a distraction today? Not only does 12+1=11+2, but the letters “twelve plus one” rearrange to give you “eleven plus two”

Your task is to write a program that finds equations similar to Tyson’s that form anagrams both in their symbols and in their letters.
