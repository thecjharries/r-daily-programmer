## Prompt

Given a binary matrix like this:

    0 1 1 1 1 0
    1 0 0 1 1 1
    1 0 1 1 1 1
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    0 1 1 1 1 0

Output the clues for a [nonogram puzzle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram) in the format of "top clues, empty line, bottom clues", with clues separated by spaces:

    3
    1 2
    1 3
    5
    5
    3

    4
    1 3
    1 4
    6
    4

That is, count the contiguous groups of "1" bits and their sizes, first in columns, then in rows.
