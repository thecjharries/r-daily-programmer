# [](#IntermediateIcon) *(Intermediate)*: De Morgan's Law

[De Morgan's Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan's_laws) is a neat law of Boolean propositional logic, helpful in every-day programming. It helps with inverting a boolean expression to get the opposite expression. [Wolfram Mathworld](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/deMorgansLaws.html) has a much more correct definition using set theory, being equivalent to [Boolean expressions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra).

That's important since programming is all about Boolean-expressions! If you want to invert some "if" conditional code (that is, to compute the test for the "else" fall-through case), you need to apply the Law's two transformations:

  * The not ( of expression-A and expression-B) is-equivalent-to not expression-A or not expression-B
  * The not ( of expression-A or expression-B) is-equivalent-to not expression-A and not expression-B

An interpretation of these rules, helpful for applying it, is that you first apply the *not*-operator on all expressions, then replace all *and*s with *or*s, and vice-versa. This gets much more tricky and complex when order of operations come in play with parentheses (nested expressions).

Your goal is to take a C-like language's Boolean expression, and apply De Morgan's Law on it. You may choose to simplify the resulting expression as much as possible for epic bonus poinst; consider reading into [Karnaugh maps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnaugh_map) as one approach. "Simplified" is measured in the least-amount of variables and operators required (not counting parentheses).

# Formal Inputs & Outputs
## Input Description

The grammar of this C-like language is English-language space-delimited words, uses parentheses for nested expressions, with variables strictly being lower-case alpha-numeric. The reserved key-word for logical-and is "AND", with logical-or "OR", and logical-not "NOT". The expression will be in [Infix-notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation).

Note that the "NOT" is a unary operator, meaning it always applies first to variables on the right of itself, or to a full expression. The expression "NOT a OR b" is equivalent to "(NOT a) OR b", but not "NOT (a or b)".

## Output Description

Given the expression, print it's inverse using the same grammar and given variables. Simplify the expression for epic bonus points.

# Sample Inputs & Outputs
## Sample Inputs

    a
    NOT a
