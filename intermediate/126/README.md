## Prompt

# [](#IntermediateIcon) *(Intermediate)*: Perfect P'th Powers

An integer X is a "perfect square power" if there is some integer Y such that Y^2 = X. An integer X is a "perfect cube power" if there is some integer Y such that Y^3 = X. We can extrapolate this where P is the power in question: an integer X is a "perfect p'th power" if there is some integer Y such that Y^P = X.

Your goal is to find the highest value of P for a given X such that for some unknown integer Y, Y^P should equal X. You can expect the given input integer X to be within the range of an unsigned 32-bit integer (0 to 4,294,967,295).

# Formal Inputs & Outputs
## Input Description

You will be given a single integer on a single line of text through standard console input. This integer will range from 0 to 4,294,967,295 (the limits of a 32-bit unsigned integer).

## Output Description

You must print out to standard console the highest value P that fits the above problem description's requirements.
