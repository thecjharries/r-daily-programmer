## Prompt

This idea is to implement the [haar wavelet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haar_wavelet) transform on an array of length 2^n . This algorithm is a critical algorithm for many image compression and image processing applications, and it is relatively simple both recursively and iteratively.


The solution should take in as input an array of floating-point values, and return an array of floating point values that in some sense implements the haar wavelet transform.
