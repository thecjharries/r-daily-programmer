## Note

I didn't really solve this. I converted an existing Python solution. Numerical analysis is clearly a problematic area for me so, hopefully, after a few more of these, I'll be able to start stitching my math degree together with my code hobby. One can hope.

## Prompt

Happy (Be-Lated) Pi Day!  To celebrate, write a program that calculates a list of rational approximations of Pi.  Output should look like:

3/1, 22/7, 333/106, 355/113, 52163/16604, 103993/33102, ...

Thanks to Cosmologicon for this programming suggestion in /r/dailyprogrammer_ideas!
