## Prompt

You are given a list of 999,998 integers, which include all the integers between 1 and 1,000,000 (inclusive on both ends) in some unknown order, with the exception of two numbers which have been removed. By making only *one pass* through the data and using only a constant amount of memory (i.e. O(1) memory usage), can you figure out what two numbers have been excluded?


Note that since you are only allowed one pass through the data, you are not allowed to sort the list!

EDIT: clarified problem
