## Prompt

Imagine you are given a function flip() that returns a random bit (0 or 1 with equal probability). Write a program that uses flip to generate a random number in the range 0...N-1 such that each of the N numbers is generated with equal probability. For instance, if your program is run with N = 6, then it will generate the number 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 with equal probability.

N can be any integer >= 2.

Pseudocode is okay.

You're not allowed to use rand or anything that maintains state other than flip.
