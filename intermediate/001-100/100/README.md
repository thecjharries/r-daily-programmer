## Prompt

Write a program called 'censor' that takes in one argument on the command line.  This argument is the filename of a newline-separated wordlist of profanity such as

http://urbanoalvarez.es/blog/2008/04/04/bad-words-list/ or

http://www.bannedwordlist.com/SwearWordResources.htm

The program should then read a text from standard in, and print it out again, but replacing every instance of a word in the wordlist with a 'censored' version.
The censored version of a word has the same first character as the word, and the rest of the characters are replaced with '*'.

For example, the 'censored' version of 'peter' would be 'p****'

Example:

    >echo 'You jerkface!' | censor badwords.txt
    You j***face!
