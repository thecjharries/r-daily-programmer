## Prompt

Find all the subsets of a set of non-negative integers where the largest number is the sum of the remaining numbers, and return a count of the number of them. For instance, for the set { 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 } the subsets are 1+2=3, 1+3=4, 2+4=6, and 1+2+3=6, so the result is 4 subsets. Apply your program to the set { 3, 4, 9, 14, 15, 19, 28, 37, 47, 50, 54, 56, 59, 61, 70, 73, 78, 81, 92, 95, 97, 99 }.

Your task is to write a program to solve the challenge.

Bonus: you might like to apply your solution to the set of prime numbers less than 2^10
