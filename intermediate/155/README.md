## Prompt

# **Description**


One of the ways that chess games are tracked during play is to assign values to each piece and then look at the pieces that remain on the board for each player. After several moves where pieces have been taken, one can quickly determine who has an advantage.


Pieces are assigned standard valuations:

* pawns are worth one point each.
* Knights and bishops 3 points each
* A Rook is worth 5
* The Queen is worth 9 points.
* The Kings true value is infinite but you shouldn't need to worry about this

More info on chess values can be seen [HERE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_piece_relative_value)


# **Input Description**

Each line of input will be given in standard chess algebraic notation:

Here's a picture of the notation to give you an idea : [Image](http://home.comcast.net/~danheisman/images/Record_board.jpg)

* columns are given a-h and rows are given 1-8 (starting with white's back row). For reference the queens are on d1 (white) and d8 (black).
* Pieces (except for pawns) have a capital letter associated with them:

 King = K; Knight = N; Queen = Q; Rook = R; Bishop = B; None = pawns, they are just specified by their file.
* Captures are marked with an "x":

 e.g. "Qxe5" for "queen captures the piece on square e5"; pawn captures are given by file, for example "exd5".

* Castling is indicated as such: O-O for kingside, O-O-O Queenside. Check is indicated by a "+" and checkmate is given by "mate" or "#".

# **Formal Input Description**

Three values per line: move number, then white's move, then black's move using chess algebraic notation.

Example:

1. e4 e5          <-- White's pawn to e4, Black's pawn moves to e5
2. Nf3 Nc6       <-- White's Knight moves to f3, Black's Knight moves to c6
3. Bb5 Nf6       <-- White's Bishop moves to b5, Black's Knight moves to f6
4. d3 Bc5        <-- White's Pawn moves to d3, Black's Bishop moves to c5

etc...



# **Formal Output Description**

Your program should emit two values, one for white and one for black, at the end of the series of moves (for an incomplete game).
