## Prompt

# [](#IntermediateIcon) _(Intermediate)_: Novel Compression, pt. 2: Compressing the Data

Welcome to Part 2 of this week's Theme Week. Today we are (predictably) doing the opposite of Monday's challenge. We will be taking uncompressed data, running it through a compression algorithm, and printing compressed data. The grammar and format is exactly the same as last time.

You are still advised to write your program in a way that can be easily adapted and extended later on. A challenge later this week will involve putting all of your work together into a fully featured program!

# Formal Inputs and Outputs

## Input Description

The input will simply be uncompressed textual data. At the end, an EOF symbol is printed (note: in Windows an EOF is entered using Ctrl-Z on the console, and in Linux an EOF is entered using Ctrl-D at a terminal - or alternatively pipe a file containing the input using `cat`.)

## Data Format

[Same rules as before](/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/25clki/5122014_challenge_162_easy_novel_compression_pt_1/). All words must go into a dictionary (just a list of words.)

* If a lower-case word (eg. `stanley`) is encountered, print its index in the dictionary, followed by a space.

* If a capitalised word (first letter is upper-case, eg. `Stanley`) is encountered, print its index in the dictionary, followed by a caret (`^`), followed by a space.

* If an upper-case word (eg. `Stanley`) is encountered, print its index in the dictionary, followed by an exclamation point (`!`), followed by a space.

* If the previous and next words encountered are joined by a hyphen rather than a space (eg. `hunter-gatherer`), print a hyphen (`-`), followed by a space (eg. `44 - 47 `).

* If word is followed by any of the following symbols: `. , ? ! ; :`, print that symbol after it, followed by another space (eg. `44 !`).

* If a new line is encountered, print the letter `R`, followed by a space.

* If the end of the input has been reached, print the letter `E`, followed by a space.

**Note**: All words will be in the Latin alphabet.

Now for an important bit. If you encounter any of the following:

* A word is capitalised in any other different way than above,

* A word is not alphabetical (eg. has numbers in it),

* A symbol not in `. , ? ! ; :` is encountered,

* Two or more symbols are next to each other like `??1`),

Then you must print an error message and then stop, because our simple basic compression format cannot account for these cases. Normally a practical compression system would handle it more gracefully, but this is just a challenge after all so just drop them.

## Example Data

Therefore, if our input is given as:

    The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
    Or, did it?

Then the output data is:

    11
    the
    quick
    brown
    fox
    jumps
    over
    lazy
    dog
    or
    did
    it
    0^ 1 2 3 4 5 0 6 7 . R 8^ , 9 10 ? E

## Output Description

Print the resultant data from your compression algorithm, using the rules described above.

# Challenge

## Challenge Input

    I would not, could not, in the rain.
    Not in the dark. Not on a train.
    Not in a car. Not in a tree.
    I do not like them, Sam, you see.
    Not in a house. Not in a box.
    Not with a mouse. Not with a fox.
    I will not eat them here or there.
    I do not like them anywhere!

## Example Challenge Output

Your output may vary slightly depending on how you populate your word dictionary.
