# Notes

This is not a well-defined exercise.

I like that it asks to encrypt whitespace, numbers, and symbols. I think I'll do a basic Caesar cipher just over all ASCII characters in stead of just letters.

I reduced ASCII to the printable chars as defined [here](https://cs.smu.ca/~porter/csc/ref/ascii.html).
