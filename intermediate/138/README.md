## Prompt

# [](#IntermediateIcon) *(Intermediate)*: Overlapping Circles

Computing the volume of a circle is pretty straight-forward: Pi x Radius x Radius, or simply Pi x r ^2.

What if we wanted to computer the volume of two circles? Easy, just sum it! Yet, what about two intersecting circles, much like the classic [Venn diagram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Venn0111.svg)?

Your goal is to write a program that takes two unit-circles (radius of one) at given locations, and compute that shape's volume. You must make sure to *not* double-count the intersecting volume! (i.e. you must not sum this [red area](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Venn0001.svg) twice).

As a starting point, check out how to compute [circle segments](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_segment).

# Formal Inputs & Outputs
## Input Description

On standard input you will be given four floating-point space-delimited values: x y u w. x and y are the first circle's position in [Cartesian coordinates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system). The second pair u and w are the second circle's position.

Note that the given circles may not actually intersect. If this is the case, return the sum of both circles (which will always be Pi x 2 since our circles are unit-circles).

## Output Description

Print the summed volume of the two circles, up to an accuracy of 4 digits after the decimal place.

# Sample Inputs & Outputs
