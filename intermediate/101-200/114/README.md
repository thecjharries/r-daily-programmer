## Prompt

Given any two words from [this list of 3,807 four-letter words](http://pastebin.com/zY4Xt7iB), output a [word ladder](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/149kec/1242012_challenge_114_easy_word_ladder_steps/) between them that's as short as possible, using words from the list. (Note that the word list was chosen so that it's possible to form a ladder between any pair of words in the list.) Sample input:

    look
    leap

Sample output (any valid ladder of 5 words from `look` to `leap` would also work):

    look
    loon
    loan
    lean
    leap

__Bonus__: There are 8 pairs of words that require a ladder of 18 words to join. Find these 8 pairs of words. (Hint: a certain word appears in each of the 8 pairs.)
