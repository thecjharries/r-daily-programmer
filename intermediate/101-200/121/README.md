## Prompt


# [](#IntermediateIcon) *(Intermediate)*: Bytelandian Exchange 2
_This problem uses the same money-changing device from Monday's Easy challenge._

Bytelandian Currency is made of coins with integers on them. There is a coin for each non-negative integer (including 0). You have access to a peculiar money changing machine. If you insert a N-valued coin, it pays back 3 coins of the value N/2,N/3 and N/4, rounded down. For example, if you insert a 19-valued coin, you get three coins worth 9, 6, and 4. If you insert a 2-valued coin, you get three coins worth 1, 0, and 0.

This machine can potentially be used to make a profit. For instance, a 20-valued coin can be changed into three coins worth 10, 6, and 5, and 10+6+5 = 21. Through a series of exchanges, you're able to turn a 1000-valued coin into a set of coins with a total value of 1370.

Starting with a single N-valued coin, what's the maximum value you could get using this machine? Be able to handle very large N.
