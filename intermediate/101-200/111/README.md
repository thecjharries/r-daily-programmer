## Prompt

Find the lexicographically first valid sudoku. A valid sudoku consists of a 9x9 grid of the numbers 1-9 such that no number appears twice in any row or column, or in any of the 9 major 3x3 sub-grids. Two sudokus can be compared to determine which is lexicographically first like this: append the rows for each of the two sudokus together. Find the _first_ number where they differ. Whichever sudoku has a smaller number in that position is lexicographically first.

Here's the solution you should get:

`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`
`[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3]`
`[7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`
`[2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5, 8, 9, 7]`
`[3, 6, 5, 8, 9, 7, 2, 1, 4]`
`[8, 9, 7, 2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5]`
`[5, 3, 1, 6, 4, 2, 9, 7, 8]`
`[6, 4, 2, 9, 7, 8, 5, 3, 1]`
`[9, 7, 8, 5, 3, 1, 6, 4, 2]`

If you want more of a challenge, find the lexicographically first valid 16x16 sudoku, or even larger.
