## Prompt

For the intermediate challenge, you will have to generate a Minesweeper game.  Minesweeper boards have three attributes, length, width, and number of mines.  Given the input below, output a correct gameboard.

Minesweeper games have two types of pieces, mines, and non-mines.  The non-mines have a number, which is the number of mines adjacent to it.
