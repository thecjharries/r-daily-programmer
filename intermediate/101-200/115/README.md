## Prompt

# [](#IntermediateIcon) *(Intermediate)*: Sum-Parings

Let the term "sum-pair" be a pair of integers A and B such that the sum of A and B equals a given number C. As an example, let C be 10. Thus, the pairs (5, 5), (1, 9), (2, 8), etc. are all sum-pairs of 10.

Your goal is to write a program that, given an array through standard input (console), you echo out all sum-pairs of a given integer C.

# Formal Inputs & Outputs

## Input Description:

On the console, you will be first given an integer N. This is the number of following integers that are part of the array. After the N integers, you will be given an integer C which represents the sum-pair you are attempting to match.

## Output Description

Your program must print all unique pair of integers in the given list, where the sum of the pair is equal to integer C.

# Sample Inputs & Outputs

## Input (Through Console)

    4
    1 -3 4 10aw
    5

## Output (Through Console)

    1, 4

Note that there is only one pair printed to the console since there is only one unique pair (1, 4) that has the sum of C (5).

# Note

(*Awesome points awarded to /u/drigz for getting some important information into my thick-skull: there are linear-time solutions!*)

This is a common interviewing problem for programming jobs, so treat it as such! There is a very trivial solution, but the trivial solution will run in [O(N^2 )](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation) time. There are a few other known solutions: one that runs in O(N Log(N)) time (hint: takes advantage of sorting), and another in linear time (hint: dictionary).
