## Prompt

At McDonalds’ Restaurants, the Chicken McNugget meals are available in sizes of 6 McNuggets, 9 McNuggets, or 20 McNuggets. A number is a McNugget number if it can be the sum of the number of McNuggets purchased in an order (before eating any of them). Henri Picciotto [devised](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin_problem#McNugget_numbers) the math of McNugget numbers in the 1980s while dining with his son at McDonald’s, working the problem out on a napkin.


Your task is to determine all numbers that are not McNugget numbers.
