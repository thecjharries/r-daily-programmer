**we are really sorry about this :(** .. I just woke up now and am looking at this disaster. We promise to give a bonus question soon ...

for those who still have time, here is the modified question:

remove duplicate substrings.

Ex: aaajtestBlaBlatestBlaBla ---> aaajtestBlaBla

another example:

aaatestBlaBlatestBlaBla
aaathisBlaBlathisBlaBla
aaathatBlaBlathatBlaBla
aaagoodBlaBlagoodBlaBla
aaagood1BlaBla123good1BlaBla123

output desired:
aaatestBlaBla
aaathisBlaBla
aaathatBlaBla
aaagoodBlaBla
aaagood1BlaBla123

I am really sorry for the vagueness. Hopefully will not be repeated again :(
