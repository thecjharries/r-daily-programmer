## Prompt

Brainfuck is an extremely minimalistic programming language. The memory consists of a large array of bytes, the "tape",
which is manipulated by moving around a single tape pointer. The 8 commands are:

Character|Action
|:--:|:---
|&lt;|move the pointer to the left
|&gt;|move the pointer to the right
|+|increment the byte the pointer is pointing at (mod 256)
|-|decrement the byte the pointer is pointing at (mod 256)
|[|if the data which the tape pointer is pointing at is 0, jump *forward* to the command after the matching square bracket. Otherwise, just continue to the next command
|]|if the data which the tape pointer is pointing at is *not* 0, jump *backwards* to the command after the matching square bracket. Otherwise, just continue to the next command
|,|read a character from the input and store it into the current pointer byte
|.|output the current pointer byte as an ascii character

Any other character is ignored and treated as a comment

`[ ... ]` thus make a kind of while loop, equivalent to something like "while(data[pointer] != 0) { ... }".
The brackets match like parentheses usually do, each starting one has a matching ending one. These loops can be nested inside other loops.

Write a program that reads a brainfuck program and its input, interprets the code, and returns the output.

More information, including a "Hello World" program, can be found [on wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck).

If you've written your program successfully, try running this and see what pops out:

    ++++++++++[>>++++++>+++++++++++>++++++++++>+++++++++>+++>+++++>++++>++++++++>+[<
    ]<-]>>+++++++.>+.-.>+++.<++++.>>+++++++.<<++.+.>+++++.>.<<-.>---.<-----.-.+++++.
    >>>+++.-.<<-.<+..----.>>>>++++++++.>+++++++..<<<<+.>>>>-.<<<<.++++.------.<+++++
    .---.>>>>>.<<<++.<<---.>++++++.>>>>+.<<<-.--------.<<+.>>>>>>+++.---.<-.<<<<---.
    <.>---.>>>>>>.
