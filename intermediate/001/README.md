## Prompt

create a program that will allow you to enter events organizable by hour. There must be menu options of some form, and you must be able to easily edit, add, and delete events without directly changing the source code.

(note that by menu i dont necessarily mean gui. as long as you can easily access the different options and receive prompts and instructions telling you how to use the program, it will probably be fine)
