## Prompt

#Description:

The popular video games ***Fallout 3*** and ***Fallout: New Vegas*** has a [computer hacking mini game] (http://gamewiki.net/Fallout_3/Hacking_Guide).


This game requires the player to correctly guess a password from a list of same length words. Your challenge is to implement this game yourself.


The game works like the classic game of [Mastermind] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game\))
The player has only 4 guesses and on each incorrect guess the computer will indicate how many letter positions are correct.


For example, if the password is MIND and the player guesses MEND, the game will indicate that 3 out of 4 positions are correct (M_ND). If the password is COMPUTE and the player guesses PLAYFUL, the game will report 0/7. While some of the letters match, they're in the wrong position.


Ask the player for a difficulty (very easy, easy, average, hard, very hard), then present the player with 5 to 15 words of the same length. The length can be 4 to 15 letters. More words and letters make for a harder puzzle. The player then has 4 guesses, and on each incorrect guess indicate the number of correct positions.


Here's an example game:


    Difficulty (1-5)? 3
    SCORPION
    FLOGGING
    CROPPERS
    MIGRAINE
    FOOTNOTE
    REFINERY
    VAULTING
    VICARAGE
    PROTRACT
    DESCENTS
    Guess (4 left)? migraine
    0/8 correct
    Guess (3 left)? protract
    2/8 correct
    Guess (2 left)? croppers
    8/8 correct
    You win!

You can draw words from our favorite dictionary file: [enable1.txt] (https://code.google.com/p/dotnetperls-controls/downloads/detail?name=enable1.txt) . Your program should completely ignore case when making the position checks.


#Input/Output:

Using the above description, design the input/output as you desire. It should ask for a difficulty level and show a list of words and report back how many guess left and how many matches you had on your guess.

The logic and design of how many words you display and the length based on the difficulty is up to you to implement.

#Easier Challenge:


The game will only give words of size 7 in the list of words.
