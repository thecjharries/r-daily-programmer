## Prompt

Because I want to watch the world burn, write a program that accepts a sentence as input and outputs the sentence in leetspeak.  [Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet) is a link for a leetspeak translation table.  Since leetspeak has multiple character selections per letter, randomly pick the character selection.  The challenging part will be to be a resourceful developer and write a utility or use an existing application to save the table into a format that you will load in your program to do the translation.  Oh yeah, if the input sentence contains one !, for the love of God translate that into !!!!11!!!1! ;)
