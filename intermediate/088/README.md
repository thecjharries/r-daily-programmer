## Prompt

Make a program that given a certain month in a certain year, it prints out a calendar for that month in a nice calendar format.

For instance, for January 2012, it should print out something like:

    +--------------------+
    |      January       |
    +--------------------+
    |M |T |W |T |F |S |S |
    +--------------------+
    |  |  |  |  |  |  | 1|
    | 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8|
    | 9|10|11|12|13|14|15|
    |16|17|18|19|20|21|22|
    |23|24|25|26|27|28|29|
    |30|31|  |  |  |  |  |
    +--------------------+

It doesn't have to look exactly like this, this is just an example. For instance, where I come from, the week on a calendar starts on Monday, but many other places it starts on Sunday - either way is fine. It also doesn't need all these fancy borders and stuff, you can just print out a row with the weekdays and under that the dates.

Note that this challenge is not about developing your own routines for handling dates, so you are perfectly allowed to use whatever date/time libraries you want. Most programming languages come with them built in. Of course, if you want to, you can use the results from [Challenge #86](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/xx97s/882012_challenge_86_intermediate_weekday/).

As a bonus, write the program so that it prints out the calendar for a whole year in a nice 3 by 4 grid. [Here's an example of how that might look](http://pastebin.com/41EnYKHq) (remember to check for leap years!). Again, the design is up to you.
